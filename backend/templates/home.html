                The goal of this work is to develop a web application tool to visualize different stock market prediction algorithms using machine learning. The idea is to obtain the minimum possible error compared to the actual closing price of the stock. This will be achieved by means of users interacting through the web, as well as allowing them to filter, search and analyze different prediction algorithm models and compare them according to its effectiveness based on different parameters. The data used will be extracted from different financial APIs. The project will be developed in a Python environment using Django as the main framework.
